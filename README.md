# Building Amazon from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Redux) and Firebase. Stripe was integrated as a payment system


This application (an Amazon clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Redux), Firebase Authentication + Firestore. I have built the following pages within this application: Sign-in and Sign-up and the main dashboard where the products are displayed. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is as well handled by firebase. Stripe is integrated as a payment system in this application but complete checkout is disabled.

Don't forget to give it a star, it would be much appreciated!
